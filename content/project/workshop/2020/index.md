## **Background and objectives**
It is our pleasure to announce a workshop and training event on the use of <tt>R</tt> for trial and model-based cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). This follows our successful workshops on [<tt>R</tt> for CEA in 2018](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/teaching/r-hta-workshop/2018/) and [2019](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/teaching/r-hta-workshop/2019/). 

<!--
Our event will begin with a __half-day short course__ on <tt>R</tt> for decision trees and Markov models and the use of the [<tt>BCEA</tt>](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/software/bcea/) package for graphical and statistical analysis of results; this will be delivered by [Gianluca Baio](www.statistica.it/gianluca) of UCL and [Howard Thom](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/social-community-medicine/people/howard-h-thom/index.html) of Bristol University.

This will be followed by a __one-day workshop__ in which we will present a wide variety of technical aspects by experts from academia, industry, and government institutions (including NICE). Topics will include decision trees, Markov models, discrete event simulation, integration of network meta-analysis, extrapolation of survival curves, and development of <tt>R</tt> packages. 

We will include a pre-workshop __[virtual code challenge](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Health-Economics-in-R/CEA.code.challenge2019/blob/master/challenges.html)__ on a problem set by our scientific committee. This will take place over Github and a Slack channel with participants encouraged to submit final R code solutions for peer review on efficiency, flexibility, elegance and transparency. Prizes will be provided for the best entry.

Participants are also invited to __submit abstracts for potential oral presentations__. An optional dinner and networking event will be held on the evening of 8th July. 

Fees and a preliminary programme are provided below. 

| __Event__ | __Date__ | __Fee__ | __Available places__ |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Short course introduction to <tt>R</tt> for CEA modelling | Monday 8 July | £150 | 20 |
| Networking event Dinner | Monday 8 July | £30 | --- |
| <tt>R</tt> for CEA workshop | Tuesday 9 July | £60 | 120 |
