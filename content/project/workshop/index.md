This is an annual event organised jointly by the consortium. Academic institutions involved include [UCL](www.ucl.ac.uk), the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk), the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/), the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), [Bangor University](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/).

Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and, more generally, health technology assessment (HTA), is often performed using <tt>Excel</tt>. Despite its (perceived) ease of use, <tt>Excel</tt> incurs the disadvantages of slow computational speed and, contrary to health economics [folk theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_theorem_(game_theory)), a lack of transparency. 

The objective of this workshop is to explore the use of <tt>R</tt> for CEA as an alternative to less efficient, generalisable and powerful statistical software. General topics of interest include a wide range of technical aspects, e.g. the discussion of the many available <tt>R</tt> add-on packages, as well as ways to help users get the most out of <tt>R</tt> for CEA. Presentations and public discussions are used to address the computational and transparency advantages of <tt>R</tt> over <tt>Excel</tt> for CEA and for easing collaboration. Our expert speakers have diverse experience in government (including [NICE](http://www.nice.org.uk)), academia, and industry. We also aim at having contributed oral presentations and poster sesssions.

The first edition of the workshop has been held at UCL in 2018. The links below point to the specific pages for the various editions.
