My main interests are in Bayesian statistical modelling for cost effectiveness analysis and decision-making problems in the health systems, hierarchical/multilevel models and causal inference using the decision-theoretic approach.

I lead the Statistics for Health Economic Evaluation research group within the department of Statistical Science. Our activity revolves around the development and application of Bayesian statistical methodology for health economic evaluation, e.g. cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis. We work in close collaboration with academics both within UCL and at other institutions and our activities include a series of seminars aimed at statisticians, health economists and clinicians working in economic evaluations. I collaborate with the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a Scientific Advisor on Health Technology Appraisal projects.
