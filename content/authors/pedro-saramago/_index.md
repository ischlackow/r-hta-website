I am a Research Fellow at the Centre for Health Economics (University of York) and work for the Team for Economic Evaluation and Health Technology Assessment (TEEHTA). 

My main research interests are in the use of statistical and decision-analytic modelling methods for cost-effectiveness analysis and decision-making, with emphasis on the synthesis of evidence to inform economic evaluations of healthcare technologies. Bayesian statistical analysis and use of the statistical software <tt>R</tt> are at the heart of most of my research. I collaborate with the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) through the CHE TAR programme, with the National Institute for Health Research through a number of funded projects and with the Portuguese INFARMED IP (the Portuguese equivalent to NICE in the UK) as a member of the scientific and technology appraisal committees.
