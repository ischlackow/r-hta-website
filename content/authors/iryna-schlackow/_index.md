Iryna is a Senior Researcher in Health Economics at the University of Oxford. She is interested in questions related to chronic diseases, such as long-term projections of health outcomes, cost-effectiveness of interventions and socioeconomics aspects. She uses R to work with randomised controlled trials, routine datasets and other big data. Iryna was the lead developer of a lifetime policy model projecting outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease, which she made [freely available via a Shiny interface](http://dismod.ndph.ox.ac.uk/kidneymodel/app/).

Iryna completed a DPhil in pure mathematics and had been a maths and LaTeX tutor for many years. She finally decided to stop the teaching but quickly found herself running R workshops for health economists instead.
