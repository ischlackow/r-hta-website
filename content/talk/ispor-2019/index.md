abstract: "The uptake of findings from HTA has increased considerably with rising global healthcare costs and the costs of innovation. This increased role in decision-making comes with requests for greater transparency and sharing. Many have argued that openness can improve efficiency of HTA processes by reducing recreation of already developed economic models. However, openness produces concerns about intellectual property and scholarly credit. The ISPOR Open Source Models Special Interest Group (SIG) was formed to address these concerns. At the same time, shifting regulatory and HTA timelines and methodological developments have resulted in more complex analyses being required in shorter timeframes, stretching the limits of Excel to breaking point.

This workshop will offer participants the most recent efforts to improve efficiency in HTA. Discussion leaders will draw from their own diverse experiences as collaborators with HTA bodies. Brett McQueen will begin with an overview of HTA goals in the context of openness and new software options for US HTA submissions. Raquel Aguiar-Ibáñez will discuss openness and use of efficient software to increase automation of the more repetitive aspects of economic analysis, from an industry perspective. Dawn Lee will share learnings from model development in more advanced software such as R-Shiny. Gianluca Baio, as a member of ISPOR’s Open Source Models SIG, will discuss some of the barriers to adoption and provide solutions."
