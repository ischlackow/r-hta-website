Academic institutions involved include UCL, the University of Bristol, the University of York, the University of Oxford, Bangor University.\nCost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and, more generally, health technology assessment (HTA), is often performed using Excel. Despite its (perceived) ease of use, Excel incurs the disadvantages of slow computational speed and, contrary to health economics folk theorem, a lack of transparency.\nThe objective of this workshop is to explore the use of R for CEA as an alternative to less efficient, generalisable and powerful statistical software. General topics of interest include a wide range of technical aspects, e.g. the discussion of the many available R add-on packages, as well as ways to help users get the most out of R for CEA. Presentations and public discussions are used to address the computational and transparency advantages of R over Excel for CEA and for easing collaboration. Our expert speakers have diverse experience in government (including NICE), academia, and industry. We also aim at having contributed oral presentations and poster sesssions.\nThe first edition of the workshop has been held at UCL in 2018.
