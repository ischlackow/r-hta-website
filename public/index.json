Academic institutions involved include UCL, the University of Bristol, the University of York, the University of Oxford, Bangor University.\nCost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and, more generally, health technology assessment (HTA), is often performed using Excel. Despite its (perceived) ease of use, Excel incurs the disadvantages of slow computational speed and, contrary to health economics folk theorem, a lack of transparency.\nThe objective of this workshop is to explore the use of R for CEA as an alternative to less efficient, generalisable and powerful statistical software. General topics of interest include a wide range of technical aspects, e.g. the discussion of the many available R add-on packages, as well as ways to help users get the most out of R for CEA. Presentations and public discussions are used to address the computational and transparency advantages of R over Excel for CEA and for easing collaboration. Our expert speakers have diverse experience in government (including NICE), academia, and industry. We also aim at having contributed oral presentations and poster sesssions.\nThe first edition of the workshop has been held at UCL in 2018.

This will be followed by a __one-day workshop__ in which we will present a wide variety of technical aspects by experts from academia, industry, and government institutions (including NICE). Topics will include decision trees, Markov models, discrete event simulation, integration of network meta-analysis, extrapolation of survival curves, and development of R packages. We will include a pre-workshop __[virtual code challenge](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Health-Economics-in-R/CEA.code.challenge2019/blob/master/challenges.html)__ on a problem set by our scientific committee. This will take place over Github and a Slack channel with participants encouraged to submit final R code solutions for peer review on efficiency, flexibility, elegance and transparency. Prizes will be provided for the best entry. Participants are also invited to __submit abstracts for potential oral presentations__. An optional dinner and networking event will be held on the evening of 8th July.

Historically, these models have been developed with specialized commercial software (such as TreeAge) or more commonly with spreadsheet software (almost always Microsoft Excel). Although these tools may be sufficient for relatively simple analyses, they put unnecessary constraints on the analysis that may ultimately limit its credibility and relevance. In contrast, modern programming languages such as R, Python, Matlab, and Julia facilitate the development of models that are (i) clinically realistic, (ii) capable of quantifying decision uncertainty, (iii) transparent and reproducible, and (iv) reusable and adaptable. An HTA environment that encourages use of modern software can therefore help ensure that coverage and pricing decisions confer greatest possible benefit and capture all scientific uncertainty, thus enabling correct prioritization of future research.","tags":null,"title":"R you still using Excel?

Background and objectives This one-day workshop on the use of R for trial and model-based cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is jointly organised by a consortium of researchers at various institutions ( UCL, University of York, University of Oxford and Bangor University), led by the MRC Hubs for Trials and Methodology and Research Conduct-II. The Scientific Committee include: Howard Thom, Gianluca Baio, Anthony Hatswell, Dyfrig Hughes, Chris Jackson, Marta Soares, Claire Williams, Nicky Welton, Padraig Dixon, Boby Mihaylova and Iryna Schlackow.\nFunding for the workshop has been provided by the MRC Network of Hubs for Trials Methodology Research and the UCL Research Group Statistics for Health Economics.\nCEA is often performed using MS Excel but, despite its ease of use, MS Excel incurs the disadvantages of slow computational speed and a lack of transparency; our workshop aims to explore the use of R for CEA as an alternative. The aim of the workshop is to present a wide range of technical aspects, including a discussion of the many available add-on packages to help users get the most out of R for CEA. Presentations and public discussions address the computational and transparency advantages of R over MS Excel for CEA and for easing collaboration. The speakers have diverse experience in government (including NICE), academia and industry. Final Programme Session 1: Invited talks (1) - chair: Anthony Hatswell  9:30-9:45. Howard Thom, University of Bristol. Welcome. 9:45-10:15. Gianluca Baio. Department of Statistical Science, University College London. R you seriously saying we shouldn't use Excel?  This talk will showcase some of the R packages recently developed to aid the work of modellers working in health economic evaluations. The motivation and general philosophy of a few packages will be briefly presented. Examples of their use/advantages over more established, but often non-optimal computational tools, such as MS Excel will be demonstrated. Link to relevant [web-applications](https://egon.stats.ucl.ac.uk/projects/).  10:15-10:35. Marta Soares. Centre for Health Economics, University of York. Using R for Markov modelling: an introduction.  This talk introduces the use of R for generic decision modelling detailing some of the advantages and disadvantages of this software package in relation to others commonly used, such as MS Excel. In this talk, I also present generic R code for Markov modelling, probabilistic sensitivity analyses and value of information analyses (using Monte Carlo simulation). R code for [deterministic](Rcode_deterministic.R) and [probabilistic](Rcode_probabilistic.R) analysis.  10:35-11:15. Boby Mihaylova and Iryna Schlackow. Health Economics Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Public Health, University of Oxford. A policy model of cardiovascular disease in moderate-to-advanced chronic kidney disease.  This talk will present the design and structure in R of the SHARP CKD-CVD model, developed using the 5-years follow-up data of 10,000 patients with chronic kidney disease in the SHARP study. The model projects chronic kidney disease progression and cardiovascular complications and mortality using a set of multivariate risk, cost and QoL equations. We will demonstrate the R Shiny-based model interface to enable use by external analysts and will discuss issues related to model functionality and speed of~execution. [Paper](https://heart.bmj.com/content/early/2017/08/03/heartjnl-2016-310970) describing the model; model [interface](http://dismod.ndph.ox.ac.uk/kidneymodel/app/).  11:15-11:35. Coffee break.  Session 2: Participants oral presentation session (3 speakers, 15 minutes each) - chair: Marta Soares  11:35-11:55. Jeroen Jansen, Innovation and Value Initiative. An open-source cost-effectiveness simulation model for rheumatoid arthritis in R.  As part of the Open Source Value Project (OSVP), we developed a flexible open-source individual patient simulation model for rheumatoid arthritis (IVI-RA model). Alternative biologic treatment sequences, parameter and structural uncertainty, and decision framework (i.e.~cost-effectiveness of multi-criteria decision analysis) can be easily explored. The model facilitates dialogue between stakeholders about relevant clinical data, modelling approaches, and value perspectives. R and C++ code is available in a GitHub repository, along with Shiny server user interfaces for a non-technical audience.  11:55-12:15. Eline Krijkamp, Erasmus MC. Introducing the Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) initiative.  This talk will present an introduction to the tools and educational materials created by the [DARTH](http://darthworkgroup.com/) (Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health) collaboration. DARTH is a multi-institutional, multi-university effort aiming to develop transparent and open-source solutions to decision analysis in health. DARTH courses and tutorial papers cover diverse applications of R in health decision sciences, including decision trees, cohort models, and microsimulations. DARTH have also created OpenTree, an online graphical user interface for building decision trees and Markov models than can output code to R.  12:15-12:30. Dyfrig Hughes. Centre for Health Economics \u0026amp; Medicines Evaluation, Bangor University. Health technology assessors\u0026rsquo; perspectives on R.  This session will present the perspectives of members of NICE evidence review groups, AWMSG secretariat and SMC independent assessors on sponsor submissions using R. The skill requirements, confidence and expertise of these groups in using R will also be discussed.  12:30-13:30. Lunch.  Session 3: Invited talks (2) - chair: Boby Mihaylova  13:30-13:50. Howard Thom, University of Bristol. Value of information analysis in R.  This session will cover the methods for value of information analysis that can be implemented in R, including linearization, brute force Monte Carlo simulation, parallel computing, meta-modelling, multilevel Monte Carlo and quasi Monte Carlo.  13:50-14:10. Chris Jackson. Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge. Continuous-time multi-state models for disease progression.  This session will introduce the theory of modelling disease progression as a continuous-time multi-state process, and how this can be used in cost-effectiveness analysis. R software for continuous-time modelling of various patterns of observed data will be discussed.  14:10-14:30. Claire Williams. Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol. An overview of a suite of code and functions for CEA in R using continuous-time multi-state modelling.  This session will give a brief snapshot of the code already available in a tutorial paper detailing how to carry out Markov and semi-Markov modelling using the continuous-time multi-state modelling survival analysis framework. It will include how to carry out deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis and appropriate graphical outputs.  14:30-14:50. Coffee break  Session 4: Discussion - chair: Gianluca Baio  14:50-15:05. Anthony Hatswell. Delta Hat Analytics; Department of Statistical Science, University College London. Existing frameworks for collaborative working.  This session will outline various ways of working currently used in collaborative efforts in the health economics and connected spheres.

However, as the modelling requirements become more realistic and therefore complex spreadsheets become increasingly cumbersome and difficult to manage. We argue that specialist statistical packages such as R should be used when the models become suitably complex. We acknowledge the difficulties associated with script based statistical software but argue that user written packages designed for health technology assessments simplify the analysis when compared to spreadsheet calculators. Additionally, we argue that the production of web-applications based on R will allow the statistical capabilities of specialist software to be available for all. All that is needed is a dialogue between the modellers and the academic to make the software available for all.","tags":null,"title":"When simple becomes complicated: Why Excel should lose its place at the top table","type":"publication"}]
